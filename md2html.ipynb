We highly recommend checking out the full version for further reading.

You will see\\nsomething like this.</p>\\n<p>~~~\\njovyan@jupyter-yutianwuldeo:~$\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>The dollar sign is a <strong>prompt</strong>, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input.\\n<code>jovyan</code> is our <strong>username</strong> and <code>jupyter-yutianwuldeo</code> is the <strong>hostname</strong>.\\nBecause we are using JupyterHub on the cloud, we all have the same username\\n(\"jovyan\" = resident of the planet Jupyter). However, we each have a different\\nhostname (the name of the computer we are using), which corresponds to a\\n\"virtual machine\" running in the cloud. From now on, we will just use a <code>$</code>\\nto indicate the prompt.</p>\\n<p>To find out your username in general, you can use the command</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ whoami\\njovyan\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>and to find out your hostname</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ hostname\\njupyter-yutianwuldeo\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>Next,\\nlet\\'s find out where we are by running a command called <code>pwd</code>\\n(which stands for \"print working directory\").\\nAt any moment,\\nour <strong>current working directory</strong>\\nis our current default directory,\\ni.e.,\\nthe directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in\\nunless we explicitly specify something else.\\nHere,\\nthe computer\\'s response is <code>/home/jovyan</code>,\\nwhich is the <strong>home directory</strong> of the user named <code>jovyan</code>.</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ pwd\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n/home/jovyan\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>To understand what a \"home directory\" is,\\nlet\\'s have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the\\nsake of this example, we\\'ll be\\nillustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle\\'s computer.  After this\\nillustration, you\\'ll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,\\nwhich will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.  </p>\\n<p>On a Unix computer, the filesystem looks like something this:</p>\\n<p><img alt=\"The File System\" src=\"https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslcourse/unix_intro/tree.gif\" /></p>\\n<p>At the top is the <strong>root directory</strong>\\nthat holds everything else.\\nWe refer to it using a slash character <code>/</code> on its own;\\nthis is the leading slash in <code>/home/jovyan</code>.</p>\\n<p>Inside that directory are several other directories:\\n<code>bin</code> (which is where some built-in programs are stored),\\n<code>lib</code> (for the software \"libraries\" used by different programs),\\n<code>home</code> (where users\\' personal directories are located),\\n<code>etc</code> (system-wide configuration files),\\nand so on.  </p>\\n<p>Now let\\'s learn the command that will let us see the contents of our\\nown filesystem.  We can see what\\'s in our home directory by running <code>ls</code>,\\nwhich stands for \"listing\":</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\nGR6901  GR6901backup0827  data  examples  github-sandbox  shared\\n~~~</p>\\n<p><code>ls</code> prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in\\nalphabetical order,\\narranged neatly into columns.\\nWe can make its output more comprehensible by using the <strong>flag</strong> <code>-F</code>,\\nwhich tells <code>ls</code> to add a trailing <code>/</code> to the names of directories:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls -F\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\nGR6901/  GR6901backup0827/  data/  examples/  github-sandbox/  shared/\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>Special directory .. doesn’t usually show up when we run ls. If we want to display it, we can give <code>ls</code> the <code>-a</code> flag:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls -F -a\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n./             .cache/   .gitconfig           .jupyter/  .ssh/                GR6901/            examples/\\n../            .config/  .ipynb_checkpoints/  .lesshst   .viminfo             GR6901backup0827/  github-sandbox/\\n.bash_history  .git/     .ipython/            .local/    .virtual_documents/  data/              shared/\\n~~~</p>\\n<p><code>-a</code> stands for “show all”; it forces <code>ls</code> to show us file and directory names that begin with <code>.</code>, such as <code>..</code> (which, if we’re in /home/jovyan, refers to the /home directory) As you can see, it also displays another special directory <code>.cache/</code>, which is a user-specific storage space for temporary items in a computer system, and we’ll see some uses for it soon.</p>\\n<p><code>ls</code> has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ man ls\\n~~~</p>\\n<p><code>man</code> is the Unix \"manual\" command:\\nit prints a description of a command and its options,\\nand (if you\\'re lucky) provides a few examples of how to use it. To navigate through the <code>man</code> pages,\\nyou may use the up and down arrow keys to move line-by-line,\\nor try the \"b\" and spacebar keys to skip up and down by full page.\\nQuit the <code>man</code> pages by typing \"q\".</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>However, <code>man</code> package is not installed on the LEAP Pangeo. But you can always google it!</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Here,\\nwe can see that our home directory contains mostly <strong>sub-directories</strong>.\\nAny names in your output that don\\'t have trailing slashes,\\nare plain old <strong>files</strong>.</p>\\n<p>We can also use <code>ls</code> to see the contents of a different directory.  Let\\'s take a\\nlook at our <code>github-sandbox</code> directory by running <code>ls -F github-sandbox</code>:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls -F github-sandbox\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\nLICENSE  README.md  sample.md  sample.py  sample.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>The command to change locations is <code>cd</code> followed by a\\ndirectory name to change our working directory.\\n<code>cd</code> stands for \"change directory\",\\nwhich is a bit misleading:\\nthe command doesn\\'t change the directory,\\nit changes the shell\\'s idea of what directory we are in.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s say we want to move to the <code>github-sandbox</code> directory we saw above.  We can\\nuse the following series of commands to get there:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ cd github-sandbox\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>We now know how to go down the directory tree, but\\nhow do we go up?<br />\\nThere is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level\\nthat looks like this:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ cd ..\\n~~~</p>\\n<p><code>..</code> is a special directory name meaning\\n\"the directory containing this one\",\\nor more succinctly,\\nthe <strong>parent</strong> of the current directory.\\nSure enough,\\nif we run <code>pwd</code> after running <code>cd ..</code>, we\\'re back in <code>/home/jovyan</code>:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ pwd\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n/home/jovyan\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>These then, are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:\\n<code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code> and <code>cd</code>.  Let\\'s explore some variations on those commands.  What happens\\nif you type <code>cd</code> on its own, without giving\\na directory?  </p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ cd\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>How can you check what happened?  <code>pwd</code> gives us the answer!  </p>\\n<p>~~~ <br />\\n$ pwd\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n/home/jovyan\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>It turns out that <code>cd</code> without an argument will return you to your home directory,\\nwhich is great if you\\'ve gotten lost in your own filesystem. </p>\\n<h4>Tab Completion</h4>\\n<p>Typing the full path to directories and files can be slow and annoying.\\nFortunately, we have \"tab completion\" to help us. Try typing <code>cd sh</code> and then\\npress the <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>. The system will try to \"auto complete\" your command.\\nPressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files, and so on.\\nThis is called <strong>tab completion</strong>,\\nand we will see it in many other tools as we go on.</p>\\n<h2>Working with Files and Directories</h2>\\n<p>We now know how to explore files and directories,\\nbut how do we create them in the first place?\\nLet\\'s go back to our home directory\\nand use <code>ls -F</code> to see what it contains:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ cd\\n$ pwd\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n/home/jovyan\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s create a new directory called <code>thesis</code> using the command <code>mkdir thesis</code>\\n(which has no output):</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ mkdir thesis\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>As you might guess from its name,\\n<code>mkdir</code> means \"make directory\".\\nSince <code>thesis</code> is a relative path\\n(i.e., doesn\\'t have a leading slash),\\nthe new directory is created in the current working directory:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls -F\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\nGR6901/  GR6901backup0827/  data/  examples/  github-sandbox/  shared/  thesis/\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>Since we\\'ve just created the <code>thesis</code> directory, there\\'s nothing in it yet:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls -F thesis\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s change our working directory to <code>thesis</code> using <code>cd</code>.\\nWe then create a blank new file called <code>draft.txt</code> using the <code>touch command</code>:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ cd thesis\\n$ touch draft.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>Now we can edit the file in JupyterLab\\'s text editor. </p>\\n<p>The most widely used command-line editors are <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code>, and <code>nano</code>. Since <code>vim</code> is available on the LEAP Pangeo, let\\'s talk about <code>vim</code>.</p>\\n<p>We can open an existing file by entering <code>vim</code> in the shell followed by the name of the file:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ vim draft.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>When we first open a document, we always start in normal mode, in which we can easily copy, paste, and delete (as well as other functionality). To enter insert mode to add and remove text, press the letter <code>i</code> or the <code>Insert</code> key.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s type in a few lines of text.</p>\\n<p>Once we\\'re happy with our text, to exit insert mode, press the <code>Esc</code> key. We can save a file that is currently open by entering the <code>:w</code> command. We can then quit an open file by entering the <code>:q</code> command. If you have made any edits without saving, you will see an error message. If you wish to quit without saving the edits, use <code>:q!</code>.</p>\\n<p>More on <code>vim</code> can be found <a href=\"\" title=\"https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/linux/text-editors/vim\">here</a> for instance.</p>\\n<p><code>ls</code> now shows that we have created a file called <code>draft.txt</code>:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls\\ndraft.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s tidy up by running <code>rm draft.txt</code>:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ rm draft.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>This command removes files (<code>rm</code> is short for \"remove\").\\nIf we run <code>ls</code> again,\\nits output is empty once more,\\nwhich tells us that our file is gone:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls\\n~~~</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Your home directory is intended only for notebooks, analysis scripts, and small datasets (&lt; 1 GB). It is not an appropriate place to store large datasets. Unlike the cloud buckets, these directories use an underlying storage with a rigid limit. If a single user fills up the space, the Hub crashes for everyone. LEAP Pangeo recommends users use less than 25GB and enforce a hard limit of 50GB. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>To check how much space you are using in your home directory open a terminal window on the hub and run:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ du -h --max-depth=1 ~/ | sort -h\\n~~~</p>\\n<h3>Good names for files and directories</h3>\\n<p>Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful\\n when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful\\n tips for the names of your files.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Don\\'t use whitespaces.</p>\\n<p>Whitespaces can make a name more meaningful\\n   but since whitespace is used to break arguments on the command line\\n   is better to avoid them on name of files and directories.\\nYou can use <code>-</code> or <code>_</code> instead of whitespace.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Don\\'t begin the name with <code>-</code> (dash).</p>\\n<p>Commands treat names starting with <code>-</code> as options.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Stick with letters, numbers, <code>.</code> (period), <code>-</code> (dash) and <code>_</code> (underscore).</p>\\n<p>Many other characters have special meanings on the command line.\\nWe will learn about some of these during this lesson.\\nThere are special characters that can cause your command to not work as\\nexpected and can even result in data loss.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have whitespace\\n or another non-alphanumeric character, you should surround the name in quotes (<code>\"\"</code>).</p>\\n<h3>Deleting Is Forever</h3>\\n<p>The Unix shell doesn\\'t have a trash bin that we can recover deleted\\nfiles from (though most graphical interfaces to Unix do).  Instead,\\nwhen we delete files, they are unhooked from the file system so that\\ntheir storage space on disk can be recycled. Tools for finding and\\nrecovering deleted files do exist, but there\\'s no guarantee they\\'ll\\nwork in any particular situation, since the computer may recycle the\\nfile\\'s disk space right away.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s re-create that file and then move up one directory to <code>/home/jovyan</code> using <code>cd ..</code>:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ touch draft.txt\\n$ cd ..\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>If we try to remove the entire <code>thesis</code> directory using <code>rm thesis</code>,\\nwe get an error message:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ rm thesis\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\nrm: cannot remove <code>thesis</code>: Is a directory\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>This happens because <code>rm</code> by default only works on files, not directories.</p>\\n<p>To really get rid of <code>thesis</code> we must also delete the file <code>draft.txt</code>.\\nWe can do this with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion\">recursive</a> option for <code>rm</code>:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ rm -r thesis\\n~~~</p>\\n<h3>With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility</h3>\\n<p>Removing the files in a directory recursively can be very dangerous\\n operation. If we\\'re concerned about what we might be deleting we can\\n add the \"interactive\" flag <code>-i</code> to <code>rm</code> which will ask us for confirmation\\n before each step</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n $ rm -r -i thesis\\n rm: descend into directory ‘thesis’? y\\n rm: remove regular file ‘thesis/draft.txt’? y\\n rm: remove directory ‘thesis’? y\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>This removes everything in the directory, then the directory itself, asking\\n at each step for you to confirm the deletion.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s create that directory and file one more time.</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ mkdir thesis\\n$ touch thesis/draft.txt\\n$ ls thesis\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\ndraft.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p><code>draft.txt</code> isn\\'t a particularly informative name,\\nso let\\'s change the file\\'s name using <code>mv</code>,\\nwhich is short for \"move\":</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>The first parameter tells <code>mv</code> what we\\'re \"moving\",\\nwhile the second is where it\\'s to go.\\nIn this case,\\nwe\\'re moving <code>thesis/draft.txt</code> to <code>thesis/quotes.txt</code>,\\nwhich has the same effect as renaming the file.\\nSure enough,\\n<code>ls</code> shows us that <code>thesis</code> now contains one file called <code>quotes.txt</code>:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls thesis\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\nquotes.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>One has to be careful when specifying the target file name, since <code>mv</code> will\\nsilently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could\\nlead to data loss. An additional flag, <code>mv -i</code> (or <code>mv --interactive</code>),\\ncan be used to make <code>mv</code> ask you for confirmation before overwriting.</p>\\n<p>Just for the sake of consistency,\\n<code>mv</code> also works on directories</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s move <code>quotes.txt</code> into the current working directory.\\nWe use <code>mv</code> once again,\\nbut this time we\\'ll just use the name of a directory as the second parameter\\nto tell <code>mv</code> that we want to keep the filename,\\nbut put the file somewhere new.\\n(This is why the command is called \"move\".)\\nIn this case,\\nthe directory name we use is the special directory name <code>.</code> that we mentioned earlier.</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.\\n<code>ls</code> now shows us that <code>thesis</code> is empty:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls thesis\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>Further,\\n<code>ls</code> with a filename or directory name as a parameter only lists that file or directory.\\nWe can use this to see that <code>quotes.txt</code> is still in our current directory:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ls quotes.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\nquotes.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>The <code>cp</code> command works very much like <code>mv</code>,\\nexcept it copies a file instead of moving it.\\nWe can check that it did the right thing using <code>ls</code>\\nwith two paths as parameters --- like most Unix commands,\\n<code>ls</code> can be given multiple paths at once:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt\\n$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>~~~\\nquotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt\\n~~~</p>\\n<h2>Connecting to a Linux Server</h2>\\n<p>We typically use <code>ssh</code> to connect to a linux server. However, because this notebook server is a linux “virtual machine\", we can\\'t <code>ssh</code> in! But we can use the terminal via the JupyterLab launcher and <code>ssh</code> / <code>scp</code> / <code>ftp</code> to remote systems (if you have access to them). For example, we can <code>ssh</code> to a HPC called Derecho:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ ssh yutian@derecho.hpc.ucar.edu\\n~~~</p>\\n<p>We can also move a file <code>test.m</code> from Derecho to LEAP Pangeo by using <code>scp</code>:</p>\\n<p>~~~\\n$ scp yutian@derecho.hpc.ucar.edu:/glade/u/home/yutian/scripts/ars22/test.m .\\n~~~</p>\\n<h2>Key Points</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>pwd</code> prints working directory</li>\\n<li><code>ls</code> lists the names of the files and directories in the current directory</li>\\n<li><code>cd dir</code> changes the current working directory</li>\\n<li><code>cp old new</code> copies a file</li>\\n<li><code>mkdir path</code> creates a new directory</li>\\n<li><code>vim file</code> edits a file</li>\\n<li><code>mv old new</code> moves (renames) a file or directory</li>\\n<li><code>rm path</code> removes (deletes) a file</li>\\n<li><code>ssh</code> enables secure logins to remote computers</li>\\n<li><code>scp</code> secure copies between servers</li>\\n<li>The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it\\'s really gone.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Learning More</h2>\\n<p>The goal of this lesson was to familiarize you with the basics of working\\nwith files and directories.\\nThere is a <strong>lot more</strong> to the unix shell and filexsystem than what we have  covered here!\\nTo ge deeper with self study, we recommend the excellent\\n<a href=\"https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/\">Software Carpentry Unix Shell Lesson</a>,\\non which the above material was based.</p>'"
